About Me
======

I am a third year PhD student in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working with [Prof. Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html). My current research focuses on data-driven reduced-order modeling for applications to char combustion and semiconductor. 



News
======
**February 2025:** I am excited to be presenting our paper titled ["Computing Solutions to the Polynomial-Polynomial Regulator Problem"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22291) at [CDC Milan 2024](https://cdc2024.ieeecss.org/). I am very proud of this work, which has produced my flagship [PPR GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyeonghun1/PPR) ; there you can find the main contribution from my CDC paper, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Matlab</span> function `ppr()`, which functions analogously to the `lqr()` function but for nonlinear systems. Also provided is thorough documentation and some examples to get you started. My goal with this function is to make it fast and easy to compute nonlinear controllers with just one line of code, similar to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;"></span>'s built-in three-letter function `lqr()`
