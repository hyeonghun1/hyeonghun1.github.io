About Me
======

I am a third year PhD student in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working with [Prof. Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html). My current research focuses on data-driven reduced-order modeling for applications to char combustion and semiconductor. 



News
