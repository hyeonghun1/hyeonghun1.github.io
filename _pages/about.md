About Me
======

I am a fourth year PhD student in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working with [Prof. Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html). My current research focus is data-driven reduced-order modeling. I have worked on applications of char combustion and semiconductor manufacturing, and now focusing more on an exciting topic of wave turbulence! 



Recent News
======
**October, 2025** I'm very excited that my first Journal paper is published in JCP ([“Physically consistent reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999125007004?via%3Dihub)). In this work, we embedded physics-preserving constraints to the Operator Inference reduced-order modeling for an application of char combustion, so the model always guarantees to generate physically consistent predictions on species concentration. This helped us to get an additional benefic of long-term stability, compared to other methods introduced in the paper. 

**September, 2025** I recently completed a summer internship in the Computational Fluid Dynamics group at [ASML San Diego](https://www.asml.com/en/company/about-asml/locations/san-diego), where I worked on developing reduced-order modeling algorithms for the EUV light source. It was a fantastic experience to contribute to cutting-edge technology at one of the world's leading semiconductor companies and to apply research skills I learned during my PhD.

**July 21th-24th, 2025** I'm grateful to have attended the [USNCCM conference](https://usnccm18.usacm.org/) in the beautiful city of Chicago, where I gave a talk on my work [“Physically consistent reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03672). It was inspring to see so many exciting works and to meet new friends in the community.

**June 16th-25th, 2025** I am attending [Structure-Preserving Scientific Computing and Machine Learning Summer School and Hackathon](https://sites.google.com/view/crg-spd/events/seattle-2025) at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am very excited about this opportunity to learn more about many topics on scientific machine learning, such as dynamical low-rank algorithms, operator splitting methods, and neural operators/ODEs and their applications. 

**April 26th, 2025** It was a pleasure to give a talk at the [Southern California Applied Mathematics Symposium 2025](https://www.socams.org/home), hosted by UC Riverside, on [“Physically consistent reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03672).

**April 8th, 2025** Our preprint [“Parametric Operator Inference to Simulate the Purging Process in Semiconductor Manufacturing”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03990) (with Seunghyon Kang, Boris Kramer) is available online at arXiv.

**February 7th, 2025** Our preprint [“Physically consistent reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03672) (with Boris Kramer) is available online at arXiv.

**September 20th, 2024** I had the pleasure of visiting [Prof. Dongjin Lee](https://redlab.hanyang.ac.kr/) at Hanyang University, South Korea, a former postdoctoral researcher from our group. I am very grateful for the chance to give a talk on Operator Inference---a data-driven reduced-order modeling approach---for a char combustion problem, hosted by his group.

**September 9th-13th, 2024** I am grateful for the opportunity to attend the [Model Reduction and Surrogate Modeling (MORe) 2024](https://more2024.sciencesconf.org/) conference, which was hosted by my university at the beautiful location, the Scripps seaside forum, in La Jolla.

**April, 27th, 2024** It was great to attend the [Southern California Applied Mathematics Symposium (SOCAMS) 2024](https://2024.socams.org/), hosted by my university. 

**December 21st, 2023** I passed my Departmental Qualifying Exam (DQE) in linear systems theory, numerical linear algebra, and computational fluid dynamics. Many thanks to my advisor [Prof. Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html), and committee members [Prof. Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez](https://patyhidalgo.github.io/) and [Prof. Oliver Schmidt](https://flowphysics.ucsd.edu/).

**July 24th-August 4th, 2023** I attended the Space Weather Summer School 2023 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

**September, 2022** I moved to San Diego, CA from Seoul, South Korea to pursue a PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego!
