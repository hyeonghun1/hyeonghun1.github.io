About Me
======

I am a third year PhD student in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working with [Prof. Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html). My current research focuses on data-driven reduced-order modeling for applications to char combustion and semiconductor. 



News
======
**February 7th, 2025:** Our preprint [“Physically consistent reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22291) (with Boris Kramer) is available online at arXiv.

**September 9th-13th, 2024** I attended the [Model Reduction and Surrogate Modeling (MORe) 2024](https://more2024.sciencesconf.org/) conference, which was hosted by my university at the beautiful location, the Scripps seaside forum, in La Jolla.

**April, 27th, 2024** I attended the Southern California Applied Mathematics Symposium (SOCAMS) 2024 that my university hosted. 

**December 21st, 2023:** I passed my Departmental Qualifying Exam (DQE) in linear systems theory, numerical linear algebra, and computational fluid dynamics. Many thanks to my advisor [Prof. Boris Kramer](http://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html), and committee members [Prof. Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez](https://patyhidalgo.github.io/) and [Prof. Oliver Schmidt](https://flowphysics.ucsd.edu/).

**July 24th-August 4th, 2023:** I attended the Space Weather Summer School 2023 at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

**September, 2022:** I moved to San Diego, CA from Seoul, South Korea, to pursue a PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego!
